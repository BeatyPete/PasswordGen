##Mockup

Another one nighter. This one should be fully complete. The only thing is that I made the generate password button start the script to select the criteria, but when specifically loading the github page on google chrome the button no longer functioned. On firefox the github page worked fine and even pulling up the index.html file on chrome worked. So I just ended up starting the script as soon as the page loads.
